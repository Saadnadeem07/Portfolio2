            <p>
                As a student, We should have a personal mission which could be related to ourselves or the environment or even both.however , it is from the thinking view of being an student. As for myself,I always want to complete my Bachelor’s Degree in field of Computer Science.That is the short time period goal that I am targeting for .My long term goal is to work perfectly in any field which I am working and make my parents and nation proud.. I have a dream to help the people of Pakistan. To fight for their rights.
